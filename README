EasyOpenSSLCA

A dead simple command line CA using openssl and make.

This project leverages the bootstrap CA that is bundled with FreeRADIUS.
For now, it just generates a very basic PKI heirarchy 
(root CA + subCA for issuing client certs). In the future, it will be
expanded to add support for different heirarchies, cross certs for
bridge CAs, and possible MofN support for root CA private key
protection.

To create certs, simply type:
make all

This will generate the root CA cert (cert.pem) along with it's private 
key (protected with password from ca.cnf) as well as a subCA cert
(subca.pem) and it's private key.

There are other targets, right now only 'make all', 'make index.txt',
'make serial', 'make ca', and 'make subca' work. 

It's best to just use make all.

If you want to clean up everything, use 'make destroycerts'.

Prerequisites:
make
openssl (any version will do)
